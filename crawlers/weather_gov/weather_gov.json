Widespread rainfall amounts up\nto one inch are possible across northeast Illinois and northwest\nIndiana, with amounts of 1-2 inches possible in isolated areas.\nDormant vegetation and elevated soil moisture conditions will reduce\ninfiltration and allow for much of this rainfall to runoff into area\nstreams and rivers.\n\nEnsemble river forecast guidance indicates the possibility of\nmultiple rivers reaching bankfull due to this rainfall. Urban areas\nand poor drainage areas may also experience areas of standing water.\nWhile widespread flooding is not likely, a few river locations may\nnear flood stage by this weekend.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts\nare possible, but not yet certain.

                "description": "ESFBIS\n\nGiven the recent cold weather, the Missouri River has again been\nforming ice below Garrison Dam. Thus far, ice has filled the\nrecently cleared portion of the Missouri River from roughly Apple\nCreek Wildlife Management Area to about three-fourths of a mile\nupstream of where 12th street southeast turns into Oahe Bend. This\nwould roughly be equal to a little less than five miles of new ice\nin the river.\n\nThe upstream edge of immobile ice as of Wednesday morning was\nroughly three and a half miles downstream of Fort Abraham Lincoln\nand Fox Island. While the future rate of ice formation is difficult\nto predict, forecast overnight lows in the single digits for both\nThursday and Friday mornings will continue to encourage ice\nformation. It should be expected that the upstream edge of\ncontinuous ice on the river will migrate upstream. Based on how much\nice has already been put in place, it is possible that the upstream\nedge of continuous ice will reach the Fox Island area before warmer\nweather enters the area on Friday. By late Saturday, warmer weather\nwill once again reverse this process and start removing ice.\n\nImportantly, pre-ice river levels were about 3.5 feet below that\nobserved prior to last week's ice jam due to already planned lower\nreleases out of Garrison Dam. This suggests that a return to water\nlevels experienced in late February is not likely.",
